    # NOTE: tensorflow / keras-tcn (needed only by TSCP2Detector) are NOT
    # pinned here to avoid fragile exact-version constraints that break
    # across platforms.  They are installed automatically by the
    # `make install` step (pip install -e .[all]) via the [tscp2] extra
    # defined in pyproject.toml with flexible ranges.
    # To install them manually:  pip install -e .[tscp2]
    #
    # legacy-hsmm extra (pyhsmm/pybasicbayes) intentionally excluded;
    # install manually with: pip install -e .[legacy-hsmm] if needed.
