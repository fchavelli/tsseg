Introduction
============

``tsseg`` is a toolkit for time-series segmentation that offers a common API
for algorithm wrappers, dataset helpers, and evaluation utilities. The
documentation is organised into the following sections:

* :doc:`guides/getting-started` – install the package and run your first
  segmentation pipeline.
* :doc:`guides/datasets` – explore the bundled datasets and how to load your
  own data.
* :doc:`guides/detectors` – compare the available detectors and their
  capabilities.
* :doc:`api/index` – dive into the API reference generated from the source
  code.

If you're new to the project, start with the :doc:`guides/getting-started`
tutorial.
