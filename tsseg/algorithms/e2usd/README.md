# E2USD (Efficient-yet-Effective Unsupervised State Detection)

Wrapper around the local E2USD implementation. E2USD uses a deep encoder
(DDEM) to learn representations, followed by DPGMM (Dirichlet Process
Gaussian Mixture Model) clustering to produce state labels.

Original implementation: https://github.com/AI4CTS/E2Usd
