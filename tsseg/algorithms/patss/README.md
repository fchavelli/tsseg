# PaTSS (Pattern-based Time Series Segmentation)

Wrapper around a local PaTSS implementation. PaTSS (Pattern-based Time Series Segmentation) performs time series semantic segmentation with gradual state transitions. This is obtained by learning a probability distribution over the different semantic segments.
