# Random Detector

Baseline detector that places change points or state labels at uniformly random
positions. Useful for sanity-checking the benchmark pipeline and establishing a
lower bound on detection performance.

## Key properties

- Type: state detection (returns dense labels)
- Semi-supervised (`n_states`) or unsupervised
- Univariate and multivariate

## Implementation

- Origin: new code
